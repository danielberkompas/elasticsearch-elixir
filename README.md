A simple, no-nonsense Elasticsearch library for Elixir. Highlights include:

- **No DSLs.** Interact directly with the `Elasticsearch` JSON API.
- **Zero-downtime index (re)building.** Via `Mix.Tasks.Elasticsearch.Build` task.
- **Dev Tools**. Helpers for running Elasticsearch as part of your supervision
  tree during development.

## Installation

Add `elasticsearch` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elasticsearch, "~> 0.1.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Configuration

See the annotated example configuration below.

```elixir
config :elasticsearch,
  # The URL where Elasticsearch is hosted on your system
  url: "http://localhost:9200", # or {:system, "ELASTICSEARCH_URL"}

  # If your Elasticsearch cluster uses HTTP basic authentication,
  # specify the username and password here:
  username: "username", # or {:system, "ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME"}
  password: "password", # or {:system, "ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD"}

  # When indexing data using the `mix elasticsearch.build` task,
  # control the data ingestion rate by raising or lowering the number
  # of items to send in each bulk request.
  bulk_page_size: 5000,

  # Likewise, wait a given period between posting pages to give
  # Elasticsearch time to catch up.
  bulk_wait_interval: 15_000, # 15 seconds

  # If you want to mock the responses of the Elasticsearch JSON API
  # for testing or other purposes, you can inject a different module
  # here. It must implement the Elasticsearch.API behaviour.
  api_module: Elasticsearch.API.HTTP,

  # Customize the library used for JSON encoding/decoding.
  json_library: Poison, # or Jason

  # You should configure each index which you maintain in Elasticsearch here.
  # This configuration will be read by the `mix elasticsearch.build` task,
  # described below.
  indexes: %{
    # This is the base name of the Elasticsearch index. Each index will be
    # built with a timestamp included in the name, like "posts-5902341238".
    # It will then be aliased to "posts" for easy querying.
    posts: %{
      # This file describes the mappings and settings for your index. It will
      # be posted as-is to Elasticsearch when you create your index, and
      # therefore allows all the settings you could post directly.
      settings: "priv/elasticsearch/posts.json",

      # This store module must implement the Elasticsearch.Store
      # behaviour. It will be used to fetch data for each source in each
      # indexes' `sources` list, below:
      store: MyApp.ElasticsearchStore,

      # This is the list of data sources that should be used to populate this
      # index. The `:store` module above will be passed each one of these
      # sources for fetching.
      #
      # Each piece of data that is returned by the store must implement the
      # Elasticsearch.Document protocol.
      sources: [Post]
    }
  }
```

## Protocols & Behaviours

#### Elasticsearch.Store

Your app must provide a `Store` module, which will fetch data to upload to
Elasticsearch. This module must implement the `Elasticsearch.Store`
behaviour.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ElasticsearchStore do
  @behaviour Elasticsearch.Store

  def load(MyApp.Post, offset, limit) when offset <= 1_000 do
    # Return MyApp.Posts, restricted by offset and limit
    # a sample implementation to get you started:

    [%MyApp.Post{title: "Name", author: "Author"}]
    |> Stream.cycle()
    |> Stream.map(&Map.put(&1, :id, random_str()))
    |> Enum.take(5_000)
  end

  def load(_module, _offset, _limit) do
    []
  end

  defp random_str do
    :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(32) |> Base.encode64()
  end
end

```

#### Elasticsearch.Document

Each result returned by your store must implement the `Elasticsearch.Document`
protocol.

```elixir
defimpl Elasticsearch.Document, for: MyApp.Post do
  def id(post), do: post.id
  def type(_post), do: "post"
  def parent(_post), do: false
  def encode(post) do
    %{
      title: post.title,
      author: post.author
    }
  end
end
```

#### Elasticsearch.API

You can plug in a different module to make API requests, as long as it
implements the `Elasticsearch.API` behaviour.

This can be used in test mode, for example:

```elixir
# config/test.exs
config :elasticsearch,
  api_module: MyApp.ElasticsearchMock
```

Your mock can then stub requests and responses from Elasticsearch.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ElasticsearchMock do
  @behaviour Elasticsearch.API

  def get("/posts/1", _headers, _opts) do
    {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{
      status_code: 404,
      body: %{
        "status" => "not_found"
      }
    }}
  end
end
```

## Indexing

#### Bulk

Use the `mix elasticsearch.build` task to build indexes using a zero-downtime,
hot-swap technique with Elasticsearch aliases.

```bash
# This will read the `indexes[posts]` configuration seen above, to build
# an index, `posts-123123123`, which will then be aliased to `posts`.
$ mix elasticsearch.build posts
```

See the docs on `Mix.Tasks.Elasticsearch.Build` and `Elasticsearch.Index`
for more details.

#### Individual Documents

Use `Elasticsearch.put_document/2` to upload a document to a particular index.

```elixir
# MyApp.Post must implement Elasticsearch.Document
Elasticsearch.put_document(%MyApp.Post{}, "index-name")
```

To remove documents, use `Elasticsearch.delete_document/2`:

```elixir
Elasticsearch.delete_document(%MyApp.Post{}, "index-name")
```

## Querying

You can query Elasticsearch the `post/2` function:

```elixir
# Raw query
Elasticsearch.post("/posts/post/_search", '{"query": {"match_all": {}}}')

# Using a map
Elasticsearch.post("/posts/post/_search", %{"query" => %{"match_all" => %{}}})
```

See the official Elasticsearch [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/index.html)
for how to write queries.

## Dev Tools

This package provides two utilities for developing with Elasticsearch:

- `mix elasticsearch.install`: A mix task to install Elasticsearch and Kibana
  to a folder of your choosing.

- `Elasticsearch.Executable`. Use this to start and stop Elasticsearch as part
  of your supervision tree.

  ```elixir
  children = [
    worker(Elasticsearch.Executable, [
      "Elasticsearch",
      "./vendor/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch", # assuming elasticsearch is in your vendor/ dir
      9200
    ]),
    worker(Elasticsearch.Executable, [
      "Kibana",
      "./vendor/kibana/bin/kibana", # assuming kibana is in your vendor/ dir
      5601
    ])
  ]
  ```
