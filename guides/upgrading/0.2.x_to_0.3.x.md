# Upgrading from 0.2.x to 0.3.x

Version `0.3.0` dropped support for some Elasticsearch 5.x features that have
been deprecated or removed in Elasticsearch 6.x.

## Rationale

As noted in the Elasticsearch document ["Removal of mapping
types"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/removal-of-types.html),
Elasticsearch no longer supports multiple document types per index.

Instead, each index is expected to have a single type, `_doc`, and handle
parent/child relationships with the new
[join](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/parent-join.html)
field.

To support this, version `0.3.0` of this client library makes some breaking
changes. You should still be able to use `0.3.0` with Elasticsearch 5.x, 
but you will need to convert your indexes over to the 6.x style if they
aren't designed that way already.

## Changes

**BREAKING**: Removed `type` and `parent` functions from
`Elasticsearch.Document` protocol. 

**BREAKING**: Required `cluster` as an argument to `Index.Bulk.encode`
functions.

**BREAKING**: `mix elasticsearch.build`, `Index.hot_swap/5` and
`Bulk.upload/5` will post documents to `/index_name/_doc/_bulk`, therefore
assuming that your index's only type is named `_doc`. (As shown in all
Elasticsearch sample documentation)

**IMPROVED**: `Bulk.upload/5` now respects your cluster's
`:bulk_wait_interval` setting. This allows you to space your requests to
prevent overloading your Elasticsearch cluster.

**IMPROVED**: Test coverage was increased to 93%.

**FIXED**: `Bulk.upload/5` now properly handles errors on repeated runs.

## How to Update Your App

First, remove `type` and `parent` definitions from all your implementations
of `Elasticsearch.Document`:

```diff
 defimpl Elasticsearch.Document, for: MyApp.Struct do
-  def type(struct), do: "struct"
-  def parent(_struct), do: false
   def id(struct), do: struct.id
   def encode(struct) do
     %{
```

Next, if you call `Bulk.encode` functions manually, be sure to pass your
cluster into them.

```diff
- Bulk.encode(%MyApp.Struct{}, "index_name")
+ Bulk.encode(MyApp.ElasticsearchCluster, %MyApp.Struct{}, "index_name")
```

Next, update your index structure to no longer have multiple types per index
in your index settings `.json` files. Also, rename your type to `_doc`.

```diff
 {
   "mappings": {
-    "post": {
+    "_doc": {
       "properties": {
         "title": {
           "type": "text"
         },
         "author": {
           "type": "text"
         }
       }
     }
   }
 }
```
